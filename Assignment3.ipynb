      "[1] MODEL-ONLY (NO RAG)\n",
      "The tone of communication around risk and accounting concerns in an Enron-like email corpus is often characterized by a mix of urgency, defensiveness, and sometimes ambiguity. Employees and executives may express pressure to meet financial targets, leading to discussions that reflect concern over how risks are managed or disclosed. There can be a tendency to downplay or obscure potential issues, with language that is cautious or evasive when addressing accounting irregularities. At times, the tone might also reveal internal conflicts or ethical dilemmas as individuals grapple with the implications of aggressive accounting practices. Overall, the communication tends to reflect a high-stakes environment where financial performance and risk management are tightly intertwined, often with an undercurrent of tension.\n",
      "\n",
      "[2] RAG-ONLY\n",
      "The tone of communication around risk and accounting concerns is serious, cautious, and urgent. The emails reflect a focus on identifying potential issues (e.g., deals not aligning with accounting policies, optimistic mark-to-market assumptions) and prompt action (e.g., joint reviews by Accounting and Legal, urgent review of exposures due to a counterparty downgrade). There is an emphasis on careful reassessment and mitigation to address risks and ensure compliance.\n",
